# Changelog

What changed in ScanRuler, newest first. The number a build reports in the top
bar and the imprint is the entry it belongs to; the `.scanruler` projects it
saves carry the same number as `appVersion`. How a release is cut is in the
README under "Releases".

## Unreleased

- **2D Measure** — a **Spline** beside the other kinds: the free curve a CAD
  sketch draws through fit points, with the controls Fusion's fit-point
  spline has. Click the points in order (they snap to the edge like any
  pick), click on the curve to insert a point, drag a pin to move it, and
  drag the **tangent handle** at any point to bend the curve through it — a
  dragged tangent stays put while the rest re-solve around it for the
  smoothest curve, a click on the handle lets it go automatic again, and
  **Free tangents** frees them all. A click on the first point closes the
  curve on itself, as does **Closed curve**. It reads as its arc length, is
  drawn on a section's cut in 3D, and leaves the
  tool as a real spline: a path of cubic Béziers in the SVG, a cubic
  `B_SPLINE_CURVE_WITH_KNOTS` in the STEP file.
- **3D Measure** — what is measured on a section's sheet belongs to the
  section: the points, lines, circles and arcs fitted there in 2D Measure are
  drawn on the cut in the 3D view, in the section's colour and hidden with
  it, without readouts of their own — and **Export STEP** writes them in a
  wireframe group named after the section, as curves in the cutting plane.
  Cut a section through a bore, fit its circle on the sheet, and CAD gets a
  circle in space to sketch on. The section's row counts what was measured
  on it, and the export key is live for sections alone.
- **2D Measure** — **Export SVG** beside Export CSV: the sheet as a drawing at
  true scale, every detected edge chain as a polyline and every visible
  element as a native line, circle or arc, in layers, turned as the sheet is
  shown — for a CAD sketch to trace or a vector editor to pick apart.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-10

The first numbered release. Everything the app does at this point:

- **3D Measure** — spheres, cylinders, cones, planes and circles fitted to the
  scan, from picks or from surface marked by hand with window, brush and
  lasso; points, lines and planes constructed from them; distance and angle
  dimensions, an assumed dimension beside each measured one, and the GD&T form
  error of every fit. A plane or cylinder can be extended past what was
  measured, a cylinder fitted only inside its drawn span, and a section cut
  through the scan lands on the 2D sheet to be measured there. Guided 3-2-1
  datum alignment, and STEP export of the analytic geometry at measured or
  assumed size.
- **Surface Deviation** — the scan best-fitted to a nominal part loaded as a
  mesh or as a STEP file tessellated in the browser, with a local fine fit for
  one region; or the deviation from a single fitted element, optionally within
  a marked region. Colour plot over the part, pinned readings, and a
  side-by-side compare view whose two viewports move together.
- **Wall Thickness** — the part measured against itself, by ray or by sphere,
  with an opening angle for chamfers and ribs; hover readout and pins.
- **2D Measure** — a flatbed scan on a millimetre sheet: calibration with
  scanner profiles, automatic sub-pixel edge detection, snapped picks and
  edge-region fits, constructions, a two-pick datum, dimensions, counting and
  free-text notes, a report with CSV export. The sheet turns a quarter at a
  time from the datum group.
- **Projects** — the scan, the reference, the image and every measurement saved
  as one `.scanruler` file; maps are re-measured on load, so an improved
  algorithm improves an old project.
- **Viewer** — mouse schemes matching common CAD tools, tablet gestures,
  standard views on the number keys and the gizmo arrows, fit to view, colour
  schemes, transparent, mesh and backface modes, and guided hints that ring the
  control to press next.
- The app now reports its version — in the top bar, in the imprint, and in the
  projects it saves.

## 0.1.0 — August 2026

The unnumbered first release at scanruler.com: ball bars and other artefacts
measured by fitted elements, deviation from a nominal part, wall thickness,
and STEP export. Deployed from every push, so no single commit is 0.1.0; it
is everything before the first numbered release.
